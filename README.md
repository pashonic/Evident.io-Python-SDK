# Evident.io-Python-SDK

This is a SDK I wrote for Evident.IO. I wrote it because they didn't have a SDK written in Python. They acknowledged what I did and rewarded me with some goodies but nothing came of it after that (from what I know). 

## Feature Highlights

* Auto generated SDK that is defined from JSON configuration file (ApiMap.json).
  * Allows for quick editing of SDK by non-engineers.
  * The JSON configuration can serve as documentation itself.
  * The JSON configuration can be used for other scripting languages. You can edit 2 SDK's that support different languages by editing just one configuration file.
* Highly detailed verbos mode for debugging.
